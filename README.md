# Raindrop
Raindrop is a location based social media application where users make posts, and other people can read the post if they are close enough to the location where the created made the post. Users can upvote or downvote posts, and the score is displayed on the map for all users to see.

I worked on this project with 4 other people. I mainly worked on front end display and interfacing. I reuploaded it here because it was in a private repository.
